# Integrate logstash ruby transform script tests with maven
[_**logstash**_](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) allows to transform events before sending to destination using filters. One of the powerful filter is the [_**ruby filter**_](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-ruby.html). You can write the transformation using the ruby script into a separate file. On top of that you can write tests which gets executed when _**logstash**_ starts. However, there is no direct way documented to achive the following:
* Use existing logstash filters like mutate, date etc. in the ruby script.
* Write tests for ruby script and execute those as part of maven build.
